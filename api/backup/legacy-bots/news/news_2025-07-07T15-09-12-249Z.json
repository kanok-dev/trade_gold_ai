  "Analysis Forecast Scenarios": "Given the recent decline in gold prices due to positive trade developments and tariff extensions, the market sentiment is currently bearish. If trade tensions continue to ease and the U.S. dollar strengthens, gold prices may face further downward pressure. Conversely, if geopolitical tensions escalate or economic uncertainties increase, gold could see a rebound as investors seek safe-haven assets.",
