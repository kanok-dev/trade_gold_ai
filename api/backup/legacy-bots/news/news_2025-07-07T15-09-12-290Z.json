  "Analysis Forecast Scenarios": "Given the recent decline in gold prices due to positive U.S. economic data and trade developments, the outlook for gold remains bearish in the short term. If the Federal Reserve signals a pause or delay in rate cuts, gold may continue to face downward pressure. However, any escalation in trade tensions or geopolitical uncertainties could shift sentiment towards a bullish trend for gold.",
