  "Analysis Forecast Scenarios": "Analysts have raised their gold price forecasts due to ongoing economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. For instance, HSBC has revised its average gold price forecast for 2025 to $3,215 per ounce, up from $3,015, citing persistent economic risks and high government debt. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/hsbc-raises-average-gold-price-forecasts-2025-2026-2025-07-01/?utm_source=openai)) Similarly, Citi has increased its near-term and 2025 average gold price forecasts, raising its three-month price target to $3,000 per ounce from $2,800, attributing the bullish trend to trade wars, geopolitical tensions, and strong central bank purchases.
