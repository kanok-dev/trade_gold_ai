  "Analysis Forecast Scenarios": "Given the recent decline in gold prices due to positive trade developments and reduced demand for safe-haven assets, it's anticipated that gold prices may continue to face downward pressure in the short term. However, if trade tensions escalate or economic uncertainties increase, gold could see a rebound as investors seek safe-haven assets.",
