([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-rebounds-over-one-month-low-weaker-dollar-2025-06-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Major News Events**\n\n1. **Weaker U.S. Dollar**: The U.S. dollar index fell 0.2% to a three-year low, making gold more attractive to investors holding other currencies. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-rises-weaker-dollar-tariff-uncertainty-before-deadline-2025-07-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **Tariff Uncertainty**: Investor concerns over President Trump's upcoming tariff deadline on July 9 have increased safe-haven demand for gold. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-rises-weaker-dollar-tariff-uncertainty-before-deadline-2025-07-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. **U.S.-China Trade Relations**: Progress in trade negotiations, including agreements on rare earth mineral shipments, has improved market sentiment, reducing gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-rebounds-over-one-month-low-weaker-dollar-2025-06-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n4. **Middle East Ceasefire**: A ceasefire between Iran and Israel has reduced geopolitical risks, further diminishing gold's safe-haven demand.

([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-rises-weaker-dollar-tariff-uncertainty-before-deadline-2025-07-01/?utm_source=openai)) This political pressure may influence future Fed policy decisions.\n\n- **Inflation Data**: Investors are awaiting U.S. Core Personal Consumption Expenditure data, with analysts forecasting a 0.1% monthly increase and a 2.6% annual rise. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-heads-second-weekly-loss-investors-eye-us-inflation-data-2025-06-27/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Institutional Activity**\n\n- **Gold Futures**: As of June 30, 2025, gold futures on the COMEX market had an estimated volume of 147,511 contracts, down from 228,118 contracts on the previous trading day.

([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/3ab4a8d47a9598d0c9933fe95e49da82?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Market Sentiment**\n\n- **Risk Appetite**: Improved market sentiment due to easing U.S.-China trade tensions and Middle East ceasefire has shifted investor preference toward risk assets, reducing gold's safe-haven appeal. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-rebounds-over-one-month-low-weaker-dollar-2025-06-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Trading Volume**: Decreased trading volume in gold futures suggests cautious investor behavior amid mixed signals from economic data and geopolitical developments.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nIn the near term, gold prices are likely to be influenced by upcoming U.S. economic data releases, Federal Reserve policy decisions, and geopolitical developments. Investors should monitor support and resistance levels closely, as breaches could signal further price movements. Maintaining a diversified portfolio and employing risk management strategies are advisable in the current market environment.\n\n**Risk Disclaimer**\n\nTrading in precious metals involves significant risk and is not suitable for all investors. Market conditions can change rapidly, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Investors should conduct their own research and consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.\n\n**JSON Trading Summary**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"priceData\": {\n    \"spotPrice\": 3322.55,\n    \"change24h\": 19.85,\n    \"changePercent24h\": 0.6,\n    \"changeWeekly\": 32.55,\n    \"lastUpdated\": \"04:30 UTC\",\n    \"sources\": [\n      {\"name\": \"Reuters\", \"price\": 3322.55, \"time\": \"04:30\"},\n      {\"name\": \"Investing.com\", \"price\": 3302.30, \"time\": \"14:01\"},\n      {\"name\": \"TradingView\", \"price\": 3294.55, \"time\": \"04:59\"},\n      {\"name\": \"MarketWatch\", \"price\": 3274.25, \"time\": \"10:40\"}\n    ]\n  },\n  \"news24h\": [\n    {\n      \"headline\": \"Gold rises on weaker dollar, tariff uncertainty before deadline\",\n      \"source\": \"Reuters\",\n      \"originalUrl\": \"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-rises-weaker-dollar-tariff-uncertainty-before-deadline-2025-07-01/\",\n      \"timePublished\": \"07/01/2025 04:40\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"bullish\",\n      \"impact\": \"high\",\n      \"category\": \"geopolitical\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"headline\": \"Gold rebounds from over one-month low on weaker dollar\",\n      \"source\": \"Reuters\",\n      \"originalUrl\": \"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-rebounds-over-one-month-low-weaker-dollar-2025-06-30/\",\n      \"timePublished\": \"06/30/2025 06:21\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"bullish\",\n      \"impact\": \"medium\",\n      \"category\": \"technical\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"headline\": \"Gold set for second weekly loss; US inflation data in focus\",\n      \"source\": \"Reuters\",\n      \"originalUrl\": \"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-heads-second-weekly-loss-investors-eye-us-inflation-data-2025-06-27/\",\n      \"timePublished\": \"06/27/2025 07:03\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n      \"impact\": \"medium\",\n      \"category\": \"economic\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"headline\": \"Gold Futures\",\n      \"source\": \"AP News\",\n      \"originalUrl\": \"https://apnews.com/article/3ab4a8d47a9598d0c9933fe95e49da82\",\n      \"timePublished\": \"06/30/2025 14:00\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"neutral\",\n      \"impact\": \"low\",\n      \"category\": \"institutional\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"sentiment\": \"neutral\",\n  \"confidence\": \"medium\",\n  \"signal\": \"hold\",\n  \"keyFactors\": [\"weaker USD\", \"tariff uncertainty\", \"geopolitical tensions\"],\n  \"fedImpact\": \"Potential rate cuts influenced by political pressure may support gold prices.\",\n  \"technicalView\": {\n    \"trend\": \"neutral\",\n    \"supportLevels\": [3250, 3200],\n    \"resistanceLevels\": [3350, 3400],\n    \"rsi\": 55,\n    \"keyLevels\": \"Support at $3,250; Resistance at $3,350\"\n  },\n  \"riskLevel\": \"medium\",\n  \"timeHorizon\": \"short-term\",\n  \"priceTarget\": \"Range-bound between $3,250 and $3,350\",\n  \"entryPoint\": 3250,\n  \"stopLoss\": 3200,\n  \"takeProfit\": [3350, 3400],\n  \"institutionalFlow\": \"neutral\",\n  \"currencyImpact\": \"Weaker USD supports gold prices; inverse correlation remains intact.\",\n  \"summary\": \"Maintain current positions; monitor upcoming economic data and geopolitical developments for potential market shifts.\"\n}\n``` "
