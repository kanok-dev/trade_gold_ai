      "reasoning": "Gold is consolidating within a tight $3,320–$3,360 range, with no significant price movement over the last 24 hours.

      "reasoning": "With price action flat and all major news sources signaling a 'hold' due to uncertainty ahead of U.S. data, initiating new positions now carries a poor risk/reward profile. The market is in wait-and-see mode, and a breakout or breakdown from the current range is needed for a directional trade."

      "reasoning": "If already in a position from 3357.96, maintain the trade with a slightly tightened stop loss at 3320 (just below range support) and take profit at 3395 (below resistance to capture gains before potential reversal). For new trades, wait for a confirmed breakout above 3360 (for long) or below 3320 (for short) before entering."

    "summary": "Gold is consolidating in a narrow range as traders await U.S. economic data that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy direction. With no clear momentum and neutral news sentiment, the best approach is to hold existing positions and avoid new trades until a breakout occurs. Risk is moderate due to potential volatility from upcoming data. Key levels to watch are $3,360 (resistance) and $3,320 (support).",
