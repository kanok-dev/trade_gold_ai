      "overall": "neutral",
      "confidence": 8,
      "reasoning": "Gold prices have shown no significant movement in the past 24 hours, holding steady around $3,357.96. News sentiment is neutral with high confidence, and the market is in a wait-and-see mode ahead of key U.S. economic data. There is no clear directional bias until new information emerges, particularly regarding the Federal Reserve's policy stance."
    },
    "signal": {
      "action": "HOLD",
      "strength": 8,
      "reasoning": "With prices consolidating and no new catalysts, the market is lacking momentum. Both technical and fundamental indicators suggest waiting for the outcome of upcoming U.S. economic releases before taking a directional position. The previous trading range remains valid, and risk of whipsaw is elevated in the absence of volatility."

      "takeProfit": 3400,
      "stopLoss": 3300,
      "riskReward": 0.98,
      "reasoning": "Maintain a neutral-to-slightly-bullish bias with a tight range. Entry at $3,355 (current price) offers a risk of $55 (to $3,300) and a reward of $45 (to $3,400), resulting in a risk-reward ratio just under 1:1. This reflects the lack of clear momentum and the need for tight risk controls until a breakout occurs."

      "factors": [
        "Awaiting U.S. economic data",

      "recommendation": "Avoid aggressive positions. Use tight stops and be prepared to reassess immediately after economic data is released. Consider reducing position size or hedging until a clearer trend emerges."
    },
    "summary": "Gold is consolidating near $3,355 as traders await key U.S. economic data that will clarify the Federal Reserve's next move. With no significant price change or news-driven momentum, the market remains neutral. Maintain existing positions with tight stops, and avoid new entries until after the data release. Upside potential exists if the Fed signals a dovish stance, but downside risk remains if the data is hawkish.",
    "keyFactors": [
      "Lack of price movement and neutral news sentiment",
