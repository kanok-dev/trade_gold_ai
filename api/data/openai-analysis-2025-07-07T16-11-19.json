            "text": "**Executive Summary**\n\nGold prices have experienced a decline over the past 24 hours, influenced by recent developments in U.S. trade policies and shifting market sentiments. Technical indicators suggest potential support levels, while economic data and Federal Reserve policies continue to play a pivotal role in shaping gold's trajectory.\n\n**Price Action**\n\nAs of July 7, 2025, gold spot prices are as follows:\n\n- **TradingView**: $3,342.40 per ounce, down 0.01% from the previous close.\n- **Investing.com**: $3,316.70 per ounce, a decrease of 0.89%.\n- **MarketWatch**: $3,343.70 per ounce, up 0.02%.\n\nOver the past week, gold has exhibited volatility, with prices fluctuating between $3,309.65 and $3,352.20.\n\n**Major News Events**\n\nRecent announcements by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding progress on multiple trade agreements and the extension of tariff reprieves have impacted gold prices. The postponement of tariffs, now set to take effect on August 1, has reduced immediate safe-haven demand for gold. Additionally, the introduction of a 10% tariff on countries aligning with the \"Anti-American policies\" of the BRICS group has added complexity to the trade landscape. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-falls-trade-deal-progress-tariff-reprieve-extension-2025-07-07/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nGold is currently testing support levels around $3,320, with resistance observed near $3,360. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates neutral momentum, suggesting potential for both upward and downward movements. Moving averages present mixed signals, with the 50-day MA above the current price and the 200-day MA below, indicating a consolidation phase.\n\n**Economic Drivers**\n\nThe Federal Reserve's recent decisions, including the signing of a $3 trillion tax and spending package, have influenced inflation expectations. Market participants are adjusting their forecasts for interest rate cuts, with current expectations leaning towards a more cautious approach by the Fed. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-falls-trade-deal-progress-tariff-reprieve-extension-2025-07-07/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Institutional Activity**\n\nGold futures trading on the COMEX exchange reported an estimated volume of 120,633 contracts as of 10:00 AM on July 7, 2025, down from 165,573 on the previous trading day. Open interest increased by 5,160 to 438,403 contracts, indicating sustained interest in gold futures despite recent price declines. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/5f1c06ab7cd6af35e76047148eafeae0?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Market Sentiment**\n\nThe extension of tariff reprieves and progress in trade negotiations have shifted market sentiment towards risk-on assets, reducing immediate demand for gold as a safe-haven. However, ongoing concerns about inflation and potential geopolitical tensions may continue to support gold prices in the medium term.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nIn the near term, gold prices are likely to be influenced by further developments in U.S. trade policies, Federal Reserve decisions, and global economic indicators. Traders should monitor upcoming economic data releases and geopolitical events that could impact market sentiment and gold demand.\n\n**Risk Disclaimer**\n\nTrading in gold and other precious metals involves significant risk and is not suitable for all investors. Market conditions can change rapidly, and past performance is not indicative of future results.\n\n**JSON Trading Summary**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-07-07T12:11:05Z\",\n  \"priceData\": {\n    \"spotPrice\": 3342.40,\n    \"change24h\": -0.50,\n    \"changePercent24h\": -0.01,\n    \"changeWeekly\": -4.08,\n    \"lastUpdated\": \"11:22 UTC\",\n    \"sources\": [\n      {\"name\": \"TradingView\", \"price\": 3342.40, \"time\": \"11:22\"},\n      {\"name\": \"Investing.com\", \"price\": 3316.70, \"time\": \"04:16\"},\n      {\"name\": \"MarketWatch\", \"price\": 3343.70, \"time\": \"21:18\"},\n      {\"name\": \"Yahoo Finance\", \"price\": 3345.72, \"time\": \"13:53\"}\n    ]\n  },\n  \"news24h\": [\n    {\n      \"headline\": \"Gold falls on trade deals progress, tariff deadline extension\",\n      \"source\": \"Reuters\",\n      \"originalUrl\": \"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-falls-trade-deal-progress-tariff-reprieve-extension-2025-07-07/\",\n      \"timePublished\": \"07/07/2025 06:45\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n      \"impact\": \"high\",\n      \"category\": \"geopolitical\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"headline\": \"Gold Futures\",\n      \"source\": \"AP News\",\n      \"originalUrl\": \"https://apnews.com/article/5f1c06ab7cd6af35e76047148eafeae0\",\n      \"timePublished\": \"07/07/2025 14:00\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"neutral\",\n      \"impact\": \"medium\",\n      \"category\": \"institutional\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"sentiment\": \"neutral\",\n  \"confidence\": \"medium\",\n  \"signal\": \"hold\",\n  \"keyFactors\": [\"U.S. trade policies\", \"Federal Reserve decisions\", \"market sentiment\"],\n  \"fedImpact\": \"Recent fiscal policies and spending packages have influenced inflation expectations and interest rate forecasts, impacting gold prices.\",\n  \"technicalView\": {\n    \"trend\": \"neutral\",\n    \"supportLevels\": [3320, 3300],\n    \"resistanceLevels\": [3360, 3380],\n    \"rsi\": 50,\n    \"keyLevels\": \"Support at $3,320; Resistance at $3,360\"\n  },\n  \"riskLevel\": \"medium\",\n  \"timeHorizon\": \"short-term\",\n  \"priceTarget\": \"Range-bound between $3,320 and $3,360\",\n  \"entryPoint\": 3325,\n  \"stopLoss\": 3300,\n  \"takeProfit\": [3350, 3360],\n  \"institutionalFlow\": \"neutral\",\n  \"currencyImpact\": \"The USD's strength or weakness continues to inversely affect gold prices.\",\n  \"summary\": \"Given current market conditions and technical indicators, a hold position is recommended, with close monitoring of upcoming economic data and geopolitical developments.\"\n}\n``` "
